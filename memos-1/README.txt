MEMOS-1	

Description:
The folder contains 3 files:

1) memos1.s —> contains the ASSEMBLY CODE for memos1. 

2) link.ld —> contains the linker file for memos1. This aligns all the data to 0x7C00

3) Makefile —> running the make file will run the kernel image on emu

Note: I am not running MEMOS-1 on a virtual disk image. I am directly running the  binary file created using qemu

To see the output go to the following destination after typing the make command:

/root/vnc/opt/TigerVnc/bin
and type the following command:
./vncviewer <address generated by qemu after make>

The logic and the program flow is clearly mention in the comments of the code.
